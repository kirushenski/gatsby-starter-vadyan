## 🤔 Why?

Setting up a new project in a modern web can be a tedious process. You often need to setup stuff like Typescript / ESLint / Jest / Storybook, and making all these tools work together can be especially tricky. You can install a framework like CRA, but it just gives you instructions on how to manage it yourself. So you need to configure your basic setup from project to project. This process kills inspiration. This is not fun!

This project is a [Gatsby starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2). Gatsby core gives you built-in performance, SEO support (via static rendering), and access to its awesome [plugins library](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/). Starter’s purpose is to give you the opinionated setup of preconfigured tools without making opinions about your next content: it can be a blog, portfolio, landing, some cool demo, or whatever you want.

The chosen toolset is reliable and gives you a great developer experience. But it shouldn’t be difficult to replace one tool with another. If you prefer `styled-components` instead of `Emotion` or you don’t need dynamic data fetching with `Apollo Client` for your next project, then just move configuration around a little bit. Removing things is always more enjoyable than adding...

## 🚀 Quick start

> Project requires [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 10.14.2 and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) v1 to be globally installed on your machine

1. **Create a Gatsby site**

   You can use [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/):

   ```shell
   gatsby new project-name https://github.com/p1t1ch/gatsby-starter-vadyan
   ```

   _Use Yarn as a package manager for Gatsby CLI because npm caused problems with this setup (with Storybook in particular)_

   Or use Github template feature — click on the big green button atop of the page 🔝

   If you don't use Gatsby CLI, then you also need to install dependencies for the first time:

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

1. **Start developing**

   Move to the just created directory and start the development server on http://localhost:8000:

   ```shell
   cd project-name && yarn dev
   ```

## 🧭 Detailed walkthrough

Here go some details which can help you get starting. Also, I will cover a few tricky parts of the setup.

### 🧱 Source content

In `src` folder you can find some low-level ready to use solutions:

1. **components/RootWrapper** — global wrapper with all providers to add to Gatsby, Storybook and RTL
1. **components/GlobalStyles** — place to include global styling like normalize, font-face, focus-visible and tags overrides
1. **components/Layout** — content that keeps the same between all pages like header & footer. Put your page content as its children
1. **components/Seo** — all meta tags to include in head via react-helmet. Reads defaults from siteMetadata, but can be overriden by props
1. **utils/typography** — helper to generate typography-related CSS from theme config
1. **utils/media** — helper to generate CSS media queries from breakpoints list in theme config
1. **utils/apollo** — Apollo Client setup

All other content was created for demo purposes. Remove it when starting a new project.

### ⚙️ Configuration

In `config` folder you can find the most of project settings:

1. **index.js** — variables for Gatsby config. Most of them are used as SEO and manifest data
1. **theme.ts** — theme variables which serve as Emotion theme

You can change theme object structure as you like, but keep in mind that `breakpoints` and `typography` fields are used in `media` and `typography` utils accordingly

### 💬 Typescript

Main config is written in `tsconfig.json`, but `cypress` folder has its own config which extends the main one. Additional config is required to avoid conflicts between global Jest and Chai/Mocha commands with the same namings

`types` field is used to **ONLY** include defined types for global scope. It requires getting Emotion `css` prop working and to avoid described conflicts between testing tools by including different types for them. Modify this array if you need to include new global scope typings

`include` field is used to run compiler only in defined directories because we again need to exclude `cypress` folder

### 🥇 Linting environment

Project setups ESLint config with a collection of recommended rules from used tools and a few opinionated overrides. Feel free to change rules in `eslintrc.js`.

Prettier config is available in `.prettierrc`. Change it as you wish as well.

lint-staged runs `eslint`, `prettier` and `tsc` commands on changed files via Husky pre-commit hook.

Similar to Typescript, for ESLint in `cypress` folder additional config is defined to solve conflicts in rules between global Jest and Chai/Mocha commands

`eslintIgnore` field in `package.json` was added to include `.storybook` folder in the list of linted directories because all dot folders are excluded by default. Otherwise, I would just use `--ignore-path .gitignore` and be fine. Prettier on other hand respects `.storybook` folder

ESLint and Prettier are configured in a way when styling rules are excluded from ESLint. So firstly, you don't have conflicts between these tools, and secondly, if you have ESLint and Prettier setup in the code editor, you'll not be bothered with wiggly red lines for styling rules

`type-check` command on pre-commit runs on all files because tsc and lint-staged don't work together

### 🎲 Testing environment

This starter uses Jest with React Testing Library to create unit and integration tests, and Cypress to create E2E tests.

We need to render components within `RootProvider`, so I've created **test-utils** module as a wrapper around RTL. You now need to import `@test-utils` instead of `@testing-library/react` in test files. Read more about this approach in [official documentation](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/setup#custom-render)

For Apollo Client mocking, `RootProvider` supports `apolloMocks` prop. Add this to replace ApolloProvider with MockedProvider with the specified response. More about this approach in [Apollo Client docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/development-testing/testing/)

I was trying my best to include testing best practices here. For example, Jest and Cypress assertions are extended with assertions from RTL and `user-event` module is used instead of a simple `fireEvent`. You can read more about all of these techniques in [Kent C. Dodds blog](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library)

### 🎨 Styling setup

Starter includes Emotion as the main styling solution with Polished library which includes some useful CSS in JS helpers.

Whole application wrapped with ThemeProvider so you get access to the theme object on components level with `useTheme` hook or on styled components level via `theme` prop.

I prefer to use styled components and css prop object syntax, but it doesn't matter at all. Just choose what you prefer best.

Don't forget to give Typescript information about your theme by exporting its types from `@theme`. So it would be like `styled.div(({ theme }: ThemeProps) => ({})` for styled components and `useTheme<Theme>()` for the hook approach

### 📕 Storybook

Starter uses Storybook v6 with last bleeding-edge features like controls, docs mode, mdx support and more. It works with Gatsby so you can include components with static queries usage without splitting them into containers and pure components. And also stories are wrapped in `RootProvider`, so things like Apollo Client queries work too.

Modify story formats and addons list in `.storybook/main` as you wish. Starter supports only mdx format by default.

To get Gatsby queries working you need to have `public/static` folder with pre-build static queries results. So make sure that you run `yarn dev` or `yarn build` command before. And if you change queries while in Storybook, you need to repeat this process again. For the same reason script `copy-static-queries` is added to Storybook scripts

`.storybook/preview-head.html` file was added to override stories' background color. In another way, the background will be the same as your global body color (in this demo its purple)

### 🖼 Assets management

Gatsby uses webpack under the hood, so all assets can be included in your scripts as modules via `import`.

Typescript doesn't know a thing about this, so `src/index.d.ts` file is intended to give him this type of knowledge

Svg files are converted in React components via `@svgr/webpack` in a build time so you get 1st class developer experience with icons and will be ended with inline svg in the markup which gives to your users the best of [performance and accessibility](https://medium.com/@marcintreder/design-system-sprint-6-the-fastest-icons-on-earth-bf91c0a47ef9).

Font assets are placed locally to give you more possibilities. For this demo, I am using one variable font in woff2 format. For my supported browsers' list this is enough, but you can also add `supports` check for variable font and fallback to simple woff2/woff assets of different weights

### ✨ PWA

Thanks to awesome Gatsby plugins, this starter doesn't do much with service worker itself. `gatsby-plugin-offline` uses Workbox which simplifies service worker setup a lot, and then simplifies it even more in one config line. But this is more than enough for the project with simple requirements. Anyway, you have an opportunity to extend basic service worker with your own custom code later if you need to.

Starter also generates `manifest.webmanifest` in `public` folder, includes all required meta tags in html template and generates favicons of all sizes. All you need to do is fill `config/index.js` with your own values and add the biggest favicon to generate other sizes from it — 512x512 png is recommended.

### 🚦 CI/CD

CI/CD includes validation checks (linting, formatting, type checking, unit and E2E testing), auto deploys of Storybook to Chromatic and Lighthouse checks. All these go on pushes/pull requests in the master branch. You can find Github Actions workflow in `.github/main.yml`.

Of course, all of these is a personal thing, and you can create your own CI/CD process from scratch. Starter's purpose is just providing sensible defaults and at least give ready to use setup to future me.

App deploys to Netlify are running automatically without additional setup requirements. All you need is to create a new project from Github repo on [Netlify website](https://app.netlify.com/signup)

Github Actions workflow requires you to have 2 secrets in your repository: `CHROMATIC_PROJECT_TOKEN` which you get when signed in with [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/start) and `LHCI_GITHUB_APP_TOKEN` which you can get with [installing Lighthouse Github app](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/lighthouse-ci/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md#github-app-method-recommended)

Lighthouse by default will run on **ALL** html files in `public` folder. Firstly, this takes a lot of time, and secondly, this includes `offline-plugin-app-shell-fallback` which is not a real page and will break your check. This is why I defined an array of URLs in `lighthouserc.js` to run Lighthouse with. Reconfigure them with your own pages (`index` at least)

### 📊 Bundle stats

Webpack Bundle Analyzer is an awesome tool to give you a sight on build content via a cool D3 chart. `yarn build` command generates the static report in `public` folder. To simplify access to the report file I've added `yarn stats` command to open the browser for you.

In addition to that, `yarn build` command generates `stats.json` file with Webpack stats which can be viewed via online tools like [Webpack Analyse](http://webpack.github.io/analyse/), [Webpack Visualizer](https://chrisbateman.github.io/webpack-visualizer/) and [Webpack Chart](https://alexkuz.github.io/webpack-chart/).

### 🌐 Browserslist

Browsers' support is defined by specifying `browserslist` array in `package.json`. This starter supports only the last 2 versions of popular browsers. If you want to support more wide-range of browsers you can override this array or completely remove it to go with [Gatsby defaults](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/browser-support/) which contains IE11.

### 💥 Aliases

To not write long unreliable import paths like `../../../config/theme` starter defines aliases to help:

1. **@/** — src folder. Component, for example, will be `import Seo from '@/components/Seo'`
1. **@test-utils** — test-utils module. Use it in test files like `import { render, screen } from '@test-utils'`
1. **@theme** — theme object. It is used to get Theme types or get theme properties outside of components. So it will be like `import {Theme} from '@theme'`

To create your own alias you need to add it to:

1. **gatsby-config.js** — to make it available in the app through Webpack
1. **jest.config.js** — to make it available in the testing environment
1. **.storybook/main.js** — to make it available in the Storybook environment
1. **tsconfig.json** — to make Typescript understand it
1. **.eslintrc.js** — to make ESLint understand it
