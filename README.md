## ü§î Why?

Setting up a new project in a modern web can be a tedious process. You often need to setup stuff like Typescript / ESLint / Jest / Storybook, and making all these tools working together can be especially tricky. You can install a framework like CRA, but it just gives you instructions how to manage it yourself. So you need to configurate your basic setup from project to project. This process kills the inspiration. This is not fun!

This project is a [Gatsby starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/?v=2). Gatsby core gives you built-in performance, SEO support (via static rendering) and access to its awesome [plugins library](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/). Starter's purpose is to give you opinionated setup of preconfigured tools without making opinions about your next content: in can be a blog, portfolio, landing, some cool demo or whatever you want.

Chosen toolset is reliable and gives you great developer experience. But it shouldn't be difficult to replace some tool with another. I've tried my best to give you this kind of instructions in [Detailed walkthrough](#detailed-walkthrough) section of docs.

## üöÄ Quick start

> Project requires [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 10.14.2 and [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) v1 to be globally installed on your machine

1. **Create a Gatsby site**

   You can use [Gatsby CLI](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/gatsby-cli/):

   ```shell
   gatsby new project-name p1t1ch/gatsby-starter-vadyan
   ```

   üö® Use Yarn as package manager for Gatsby CLI because npm caused problems with this setup (with Storybook in particular)

   Or use Github template feature - click on the big green button atop of the page üîù

   _If you don't use Gatsby CLI, then you also need to install dependencies for the first time:_

   ```bash
   yarn
   ```

1. **Start developing**

   Move to the just created directory and start development server on http://localhost:8000:

   ```shell
   cd project-name && yarn dev
   ```

## üìú Scripts list

This project uses `npm scripts` to communicate with the app. Here's the full list:
